# Deep Neural Fuzzy Model for Intrusion Detection

This repository contains the implementation of a Deep Neural Fuzzy Model for intrusion detection. The model integrates deep learning and fuzzy logic techniques to effectively detect intrusions in network traffic.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of two datasets:
- CICDDoS2019: [Link to Dataset](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ddos-2019.html)
- CICIDS2017: [Link to Dataset](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html)

Please refer to the respective links for more information on the datasets.

## Preprocessing
The preprocessing step involves cleaning and transforming the raw data into a format suitable for training the model. This includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and normalization.

## Model Training
The model training phase involves building and training the Deep Neural Fuzzy Model using the preprocessed data. The model architecture and hyperparameters are optimized to achieve high performance in intrusion detection.

## Deployment
The deployment code includes scripts and instructions for deploying the trained model into production environments. This ensures that the intrusion detection system can be effectively utilized for real-time monitoring and protection of network systems.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Deep-Neural-Fuzzy-Model-for-intrusion-detection.git
